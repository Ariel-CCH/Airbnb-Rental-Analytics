            <h1>Bike Rental Forecast</h1>
            <p>
                In this task, we employ predictive data analysis to forecast the bike rental demand for a bike-share system in Taipei City.  
                Our dataset consists of daily bike rental counts with weather and date information, and our goal is to use the historical data 
                over the past two years to build a model to forecast bike rentals in the next six months. 
                We identified several important factors that support our rationale behind our forecasting method using exploratory data analysis. 
                We then experimented with different models with our data, and tuned our final model to perform better predictions. 
                In the end, we used our method to generate forecast values for future daily total rentals.

      <h1>Exploratory Analysis</h1>
      <p>
        Our original data consists of 15 variables (date, year, season, month, holiday, weekday, workingday, weathersit, temp, atemp, humidity, windspeed, causal (non-registered users), registered, count).
      </p>
      <h3>Season variables</h3>
      <p>Plot 1 and 2 show the relationship between bike rental and season variables. 
        The bike rental has shown growth during the past two years.
        We can clearly see that winter months experience higher levels of bike rentals than summer months.</p>

            <img src="images/season variable.png" alt=""/>
          </div>
          
      <h3>Environment variables</h3>
      <p>
        The temp, atemp (the feel-like temperature), and humidity are strongly correlated. 
        We chose between keeping both temp & humidity and keeping only the atemp. In the end, 
        we decided to keep only the variable atemp since we assume that it represents how hot it really feels for a human 
        and thus, affects a person's rental decision.
      </p>

      </div>

      <h3>Date variables</h3>
      <p>
          We saw that bike rentals on different work days and throughout the weekend have some slight differences. 
          We decided to include the date variables (holiday, weekday, workingday) in our model to test whether all of 
          these variables add significantly to the model.

        <h1>Modeling</h1>
        <p>We experimented with different models to characterize the relationship between 
            the response and predictor variables on our dataset. 
            Finally, we used our final model to generate forecast values for daily total rentals.</p>

      <h2 id = "temperature">SARIMA model for temperature</h2>
      <p>Before implementing the bike rental forecast model, we first used the SARIMA model to predict the temperature information in the next six months 
          based on the temperature information from the past two years. 
          Plot 4 is the observed value and the predicted value over the past 2 years. 
          Plot 5 shows the predicted temperature for the following six months.

      <h2 id = "baseline">Baseline model</h2>
      <p>To see whether the response variable can be attributed to the explanatory variable, 
          we ran some quick experiments using simple linear models. We can see that 
          simply using a single variable does not get clear predictions. 
          The following is an example of the relationship between 
          the season variable and the number of bike rentals:	</p>

      <h2 id="final">Final Model & Prediction Outcome</h2>
      <p>Based on our exploratory analysis, we used the season variables ("instant", "year", "season", "month" ), the atemp variables, and the date variables ("holiday", "weekday", “workingday” ) to construct our predictive model. Compared to baseline predictions, 
          our final model yielded higher R-square and lower MAE. Below is the Validation R-square and 
          Validation MAE obtained for our final model and the generated forecast rental values. 	</p>
