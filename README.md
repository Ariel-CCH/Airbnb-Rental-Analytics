In this task, we employ predictive data analysis to forecast the bike rental demand for a bike-share system in Taipei City.  Our dataset consists of daily bike rental counts with weather and date information, and our goal is to use the historical data over the past two years to build a model to forecast bike rentals in the next six months.
